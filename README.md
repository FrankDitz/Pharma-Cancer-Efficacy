# matplotlib-challenge
The purpose of this challenge was to get acquainted with using Jupyter Notebook, matplotlib, pandas, numpy, and scripy.stats. During this exercise, data collected during a Pharmaceutical experiment was cleaned up (data merged and missing information removed) so that models interpreting the data could be made. The main assistance used in the completion of this exercise came from the lecture activities for Module 4.3 (merging datasets) and Modules 5.1 through 5.3 (creating graphs and calculating stats). Outside help came from https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.stats.linregress.html which showed me how to create a regression line, calculate R^2, create a proper "f'string", and interpret statistical values. Assistance also came from a UCF tutor as well as some classmates who each helped me figure out how to code the "For loop" in regards to calculating and appending the outliers, quartiles, and new tumor volumes for each drug regimen.
