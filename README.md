## Overview
A data analysis project on pharmacological research involving a new tumor reducing drug called Capomulin. The purpose is to see how effective the new drug is compared to other leading tumor fighting medications on the market.
## Methods
Cleaning the data involved grouping the data by MouseID, removing duplicate rows, and standardizing data types between columns. Used groupby and summary statistical methods to calculate the mean, median, variance, standard deviation, and SEM of the tumor volume before creating a summary statistics table to house the information.
Calculated the correlation coefficient and created a linear regression model for the mouse weight and average observed tumor volume for the entire Capomulin regimen, providing convincing feedback of the effectiveness of the new tumor drug.
## Analysis
After removing duplicates, the data from 248 mice was used in this experiment. When looking at the change in tumor volume, Capomulin and Ramicane appeared most effective at reducing the size of the present tumors. Initial analysis appears to indicate that Pymaceuticals' new medication (Capomulin) is just as effective as the next leading, already established tumor regimen (Ramicane). Looking at the R^2 value (0.71) for the regression line comparing average tumor volume change to the weight change in the experimental mice, it can be determined that the data explains the variation in the variable around its mean relatively well but not perfectly. Upping the sample size may lead to a better R^2 value and stronger support for results. The correlation between the average tumor volume and the average mouse weight is 0.84, providing relative assurance that there is a positive correlation between the two variables. It can be said that there is pretty solid evidence for Capomulin working as effectively as Ramicane, and better than the other options tested in regards to reducing tumor size (volume) in mice.
